Hello! üëã I'm **Ziming Li**, currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computing and Information Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), advised by Dr. [Roshan Peiris](https://www.roshanpeiris.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

My research lies in the domains of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Virtual Reality (VR), and Accessibility. I focus on integrating Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents into VR environments and exploring their potential in everyday communication scenarios and training programs, particularly for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs).

I'm a member of the [CAIR](https://cair.rit.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research) Lab and the [AIR](https://www.ritairlab.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (Accessible and Immersive Realities) Lab. I am passionate about applying cutting-edge technology to develop accessible and inclusive tools, especially in VR.

Beyond academia, I‚Äôm also a web and VR/game programmer üéÆ, designer üé®, and Chinese-language writer ‚úçÔ∏è. I enjoy crafting immersive narratives and interactive experiences.
