Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Ziming Li**, currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computing and Information Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), advised by Dr. [Roshan Peiris](https://www.roshanpeiris.com/).

My research focuses on integrating Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents within Virtual Reality (VR) environments. I explore their potential applications in everyday communication scenarios and training programs, particularly targeting individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).

I'm a member of the [CAIR](https://cair.rit.edu) (Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research) Lab and the [AIR](https://www.ritairlab.org) (Accessible and Immersive Realities) Lab. I am passionate about applying cutting-edge technology to develop accessible and inclusive tools, especially in VR.

Beyond academia, Iâ€™m also a digital media artist, designer, and Chinese-language writer. I enjoy crafting immersive narratives, interactive experiences, and digital artworks.
