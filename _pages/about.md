Hello! I am **Ziming Li**, currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computing and Information Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), advised by Dr. [Roshan Peiris](https://www.roshanpeiris.com/). My research focuses on integrating Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents within Virtual Reality (VR) environments. I explore their potential applications in everyday communication scenarios and training programs, particularly targeting individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).

I'm also a member of the [CAIR](https://cair.rit.edu) (Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research) Lab and [AIR](https://www.ritairlab.org) (Accessible and Immersive Realities) Lab.

I'm passionate about applying cutting-edge technology to develop accessible and inclusive tools, especially for VR.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration, research discussions, or have any inquiries!
