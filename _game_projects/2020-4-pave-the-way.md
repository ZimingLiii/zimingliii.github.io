Pave The Way is an endless runner strategy game where players don’t control the robot itself—they control the world around it.

Your task is to make sure the robot never stops moving by dynamically shaping the terrain ahead. Using two complementary tools, the Injector (+) and the Disintegrator (-), players continuously create or remove ground blocks to keep the robot rolling forward.

The challenge lies in anticipating terrain changes and reacting quickly. There’s no jumping, gravity, or collectible abilities—just pure, fast-paced problem solving. The robot moves automatically, and your success depends on how well you manage the environment to sustain its motion. The farther the robot travels, the higher your score.
