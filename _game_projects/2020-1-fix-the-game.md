**"Fix The Game"** is an [entry for Global Game Jam 2020](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2020/games/broken-game-1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

It’s a multiplayer party game (1–4 players) about repairing a broken game scene. For some unknown reason, this scene level has lost part of its map data. Players must follow a checklist and step on hints to restore missing items to the environment.

While doing so, players need to avoid monster attacks—creatures that were accidentally added to the corrupted scene. Fortunately, newly added terrains and obstacles can be used strategically to help players survive.
Once the scene is fully repaired, the players win, and the MVP is the one who contributed the most to fixing the scene. However, if the monsters defeat all players before the scene is restored, the team loses.
