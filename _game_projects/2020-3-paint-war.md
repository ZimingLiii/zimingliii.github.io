Paint War is a 2D multiplayer combat game featuring pixel-style art and chiptune music. You can team up for a 2v2 battle, or jump into free-for-all (FFA) mode to fight against everyone else.

The goal is simple: cover as much ground as possible with your team’s color before time runs out. But things are never that easy. Each character has a unique skill that can shake up the battlefield, so you can choose to play aggressively or keep your distance and outsmart your rivals.

Pick up items scattered on the floor to make the chaos even more unpredictable.

Paint, battle, and have fun with your friends!
