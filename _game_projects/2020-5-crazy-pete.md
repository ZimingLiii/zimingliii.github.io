Crazy Pete’s Space Deals is a satirical business simulation game where players take on the role of “Crazy Pete,” a fast-talking used spaceship dealer trying to turn a profit in an interstellar marketplace. The game blends humor with light strategic decision-making as players learn to read customer preferences, manage patience levels, and maximize profit margins.

Players interact with a variety of customers, each with distinct preferences and temperaments. With five actions per interaction, players can interview, negotiate, or offer snacks to maintain customer patience while emphasizing the right ship features. Profit depends on factors such as ship stats, customer priorities, and negotiation skill. After each sale, the system reveals the optimal selling price, encouraging iterative learning and mastery over time.

## How to play

See your goal for the day in the top right corner. The customer is on the left. You get five actions per customer, and a lot of customers. Interview to figure out their top 3 priorities, but each time you do will lower their patience (and the price they'll accept). Snacks keep up their patience.  

Select a ship to see its stats. You paid the "wholesale" price, and you want to sell ships for more than they're worth. How much a customer will pay depends on:

- Original value
- Stats vs. priorities vs. emphasis
- Patience
- And modifiers (when unlocked)

Each time you finish with a customer, you'll be told what the perfect (highest) price would have been. Once you know your customers, it becomes easier to emphasize the features they like best.
