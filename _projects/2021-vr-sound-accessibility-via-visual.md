## SoundVizVR System

This project explores how visual cues can make sound-based information in VR more accessible to Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) users. In typical VR experiences, sounds carry key details about space, interaction, and immersion. However, when sound is inaccessible, users may lose important contextual information.

SoundVizVR introduces a visual system that represents sound properties and types directly in the virtual environment. The system features two components:

- Sound-Characteristic Indicators, which visualize a sound’s loudness, duration, and spatial location through techniques such as On-Object Indicators and Mini-Maps.

- Sound-Type Indicators, which add contextual information about what kind of sound is occurring, using icons and text.

## SoundVizVR As A Plugin for Game Engine

Building upon the SoundVizVR system for visualizing sounds in virtual reality, this project introduces the SoundVizVR Plugin, a Unity-based tool that allows VR developers to easily integrate the SoundVizVR visualization system into their own applications and games. The goal was to bring sound accessibility into the hands of developers and explore how such tools can shape inclusive design practices in VR.
