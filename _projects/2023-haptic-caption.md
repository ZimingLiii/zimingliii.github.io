Captions make audio content accessible for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals, yet they can fall short in real-time, multi-speaker settings where identifying who is speaking becomes difficult. To address this challenge, we developed Haptic-Captioning, a system that translates sound features into vibration feedback on the wrist, offering an additional sensory channel to complement visual captions.
