This project investigates how a large language model (LLM)-based chatbot can help university students overcome public-speaking anxiety and build confidence in interactive settings. Unlike traditional training tools that focus on delivering prepared speeches, this system targets anxiety that arises during spontaneous question-and-answer sessions. Two versions of the chatbot application were developed: one in Virtual Reality and another in desktop format. Both versions allow students to engage in realistic Q&A simulations, offering a controlled yet authentic environment for practicing impromptu responses and managing anxiety.
