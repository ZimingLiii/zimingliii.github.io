Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) strengthens digital security by adding an extra layer of verification beyond passwords or PINs. However, traditional 2FA processes often involve visual interfaces, secondary devices, or multiple steps, which can make them inaccessible and potentially insecure for Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users. Screen readers, for instance, may inadvertently expose sensitive information like verification codes to others nearby.

To address these challenges, we developed Haptic2FA, a haptic-based authentication method that replaces visual or auditory verification codes with unique vibration patterns. During the authentication process, users receive a distinct “haptic passcode” that they must reproduce or select for identity verification, offering a secure and accessible alternative to traditional 2FA.
