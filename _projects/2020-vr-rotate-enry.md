This project presents RotateEntry, a text entry method designed for three degrees of freedom (3DoF) virtual reality (VR) devices that rely on rotational input instead of spatial tracking. Unlike conventional raycasting-based typing, RotateEntry uses controller rolling motions to move a cursor across a virtual QWERTY keyboard, making text input possible even in limited-mobility VR setups. We developed three variations of the method, Rotate Column Rotate, Rotate Key, and Rotate Column Point, to explore different mappings between controller motion and cursor movement.
