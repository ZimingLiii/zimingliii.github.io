This project focuses on supporting autistic individuals in developing essential job communication skills through an immersive Virtual Reality training system. The application features AI-powered avatars that act as conversational partners, using Large Language Models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo to simulate real-world workplace scenarios. Users interact with these avatars through speech, engaging in customer service conversations and other job-related exchanges. 

Furthermore, using a web-based (Node.js) platform, non-tech-savvy users, such as job coaches, can easily create or customize new training situations by entering text prompts, allowing flexible adaptation to individual trainee needs.
