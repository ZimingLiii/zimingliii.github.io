Spatial audio in virtual reality enhances immersion and conveys vital information about the environment, but for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) users, these cues often remain inaccessible. SoundHapticVR addresses this challenge through a head-based haptic feedback system that transforms audio signals into tactile sensations using multi-channel acoustic haptic actuators.
