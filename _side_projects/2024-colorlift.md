ColorLift is a free cross-platform project for Windows and macOS that helps users, especially those with colorblind/color vision deficiency, identify and describe colors in a clear and accessible way. By clicking anywhere on the screen, users can instantly capture color values in HEX, RGB, or HSL formats. The system then generates natural-language descriptions that include the color name, visual impression, and common use cases. These descriptions are created through configurable large language models such as GPT, Claude, or Qwen, and users can freely switch models or connect custom APIs. 

This project aims to make color communication easier for everyone. It provides multilingual support and allows flexible display modes with light or dark themes.
